  <h2>&emsp;&emsp;Traveling To Uranus！</h2>
    
    <p class="welcome-message">
   Uranus, a unique ice giant known for its distinctive features, is the name of the Greek god of the sky. It rotates on its side, making it appear to roll through space. Its mysterious characteristics continue to intrigue scientists and space explorers.
  </p>
  
  <p class="welcome-message">
   Uranus is seldom explored by scientists because of its distance from Earth. So it's time to explore Uranus with your creativity.

      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons around Uranus, increasing the total number of known Uranian satellites to 15 at that time. Most of the newly discovered moons were small, with the largest having a diameter of about 150 kilometers. Five of the largest moons appeared to be composed of a mixture of water and rock, similar to Saturn's moons.

      <font size="4">Ⅱ. Rings (Ring Systems)</font>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Voyager 2 explored all nine known rings of Uranus, which were observed before the spacecraft's arrival. These rings were found to be distinctly different from the rings of Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus' ring system is believed to be relatively young and formed independently of the planet's history. These rings are thought to be formed from the debris of moons that shattered due to high-speed impacts of tidal forces. Voyager 2 also discovered two new rings around Uranus.
