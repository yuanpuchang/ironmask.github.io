      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Olympus Mons is a shield volcano on Mars and is the tallest known volcano in the solar system, standing 21,229 meters (69,840 feet) above its reference point. It is nearly twice the height of Earth's Mount Everest but more appropriately compared to Earth's Mauna Loa volcano when measured from its base on the ocean floor, where it exceeds 9 kilometers (nearly 30,000 feet) in height. Like other shield volcanoes, it has a broken caldera at its summit.

      <h3>Valles Marineris</h3>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Valles Marineris is the largest and longest canyon system in the solar system. It is located on the eastern side of the Tharsis volcanic plateau and stretches for a length of 3,769 kilometers (2,341 miles) with a depth of up to 7 kilometers (4.3 miles). It forms a complex network of canyons and is the result of crustal stretching and faulting.

      <h3>Gale Crater:</h3>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Gale Crater was a landing candidate for the Mars Science Laboratory, Curiosity Rover, which successfully landed on August 6, 2012. It features a central mound, Mount Sharp, with an average height of about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) above the crater floor. The interior contains a lowland area, with Ioavallis Fossae, that is more than 5.1 kilometers (3.2 miles) deep on average.
