  <h2>&emsp;&emsp;Traveling To Jupiter！</h2>
    
    <p class="welcome-message">
   Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is the name of the king of the ancient Roman gods. Jupiter is a gender-neutral name of Latin origin and was borne by the supreme deity of the Roman gods.

  <p class="welcome-message">
    On Jupiter, you can personally experience the places observed by Galileo through a telescope hundreds of years ago.

      <h2>&emsp;&emsp;Launch History</h2>
    <ul style='list-style-position:outside;'>
    <ul class='details'>
      
      <li>First Launch<br>&emsp;。Pioneer 10：Pioneer 10 made the first flyby of Jupiter in December 1973, marking humanity's first mission to explore Jupiter. It was followed by Pioneer 11 a few months later. Besides capturing the first close-up images of Jupiter, the spacecraft discovered Jupiter's magnetic field and probed its major fluid interiors.
<br>&emsp;
  <li>Actual Flight
<br>&emsp;
。Space Shuttle Atlantis:<br>&emsp;&emsp;
      - Launched on October 18, 1989, carrying the Galileo spacecraft.<br>&emsp;&emsp;
      - Approached Jupiter on December 7, 1995

<br>&emsp;
。Galileo: <br>&emsp;&emsp; - The primary mission was to conduct a two-year study of the Jupiter system.<br>&emsp;&emsp;
      - In reality, Galileo entered Jupiter's orbit in 1995 and operated until its intentional <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; impact into Jupiter in 2003, providing eight years of data and observations.

      <p class="attraction-introduction">
       Located in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter, the Great Red Spot is a massive storm with a width approximately twice that of Earth. It consists of counterclockwise-rotating deep-red clouds and has wind speeds exceeding any storm on Earth.<br>
It was first observed in 1878, and earlier mentions of what is believed to be the Great Red Spot date back to 1665 when Gian Domenico Cassini referred to it as a "permanent storm." The long-lasting nature of the storm can be explained by the fact that Jupiter lacks a solid surface. On Earth, hurricanes dissipate when they reach solid ground, but the Great Red Spot has nothing solid beneath it.
