  <h2>&emsp;&emsp;Traveling To Venus！</h2>
    
    <p class="welcome-message">
   Venus, also known as Aphrodite, is the name of the goddess of love in Greek mythology. Because Venus is the brightest star in the solar system, it was named Venus by ancient people, symbolizing its beautiful appearance.
  </p>
    
  <p class="welcome-message">
    On Venus, there is no "moon" in the night sky, and the brightest "star" is Earth. Here, you can appreciate our home planet through stargazing, making it an intriguing journey!

      <li>Unmanned Mission<br>&emsp;。 Venera 1VA (Venus Prototype 1VA) - Launched on February 4, 1961,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;but failed to escape Earth's orbit.<br>
        
    <h2><font color="#FF0000">Warnings！</h2>

<li>Venus has incredibly harsh conditions, including a thick, crushing atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, extreme temperatures, and high atmospheric pressure.

<li>The crushing weight of its thick atmosphere and extreme temperatures make it extremely challenging for any lander to survive there for extended periods. No lander has ever lasted longer than 127 minutes on the surface.

      <font size="4">Maxwell Montes</font>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Maxwell Montes is named after the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Interestingly, in the naming system for Venusian features, most names are based on female names, making Maxwell Montes one of the few features named after a male. It is the highest point on Venus, rising approximately 11,000 meters (36,000 feet) above the Venusian surface. It exhibits bright radar imagery regions known as the "Venusian snow," possibly due to the presence of minerals like pyrite.

      <font size="4">Pancake Volcanoes (Farra)</font>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Venus has some unique features that resemble pancakes, ranging in size from 20 to 50 kilometers in diameter and with heights varying from 100 to 1,000 meters.
  </p><br>
 
        <font size="4">Arachnoid Terrain</font>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Arachnoid terrains on Venus have a radial and concentric fracture pattern that resembles a spider's web.

        <font size="4">Coronae</font>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      Coronae are depressions with concentric rings or circular ridges. These features are found on Venus and are associated with geological processes.
