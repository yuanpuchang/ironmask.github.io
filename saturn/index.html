  <h2>&emsp;&emsp;Traveling To Saturn！</h2>
    
    <p class="welcome-message">
    Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system composed of icy particles and rock. According to myth, Saturn introduced agriculture to his people by teaching them how to farm the land. So Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth.

      <li>First Mission<br>&emsp;。Pioneer 11:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Launch Date: April 6, 1973
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;- Arrival Date: 2004 (Continues to fly in space)
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;- Mission Type: Flyby
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;- Result: Ongoing mission (as of the provided information)<br>Pioneer 11 became the first artificial object to visit Saturn in September 1979. It flew by Saturn at a distance of 20,000 kilometers from the top of the planet's cloud layer. During this flyby, it captured low-resolution images of the planet and some of its moons, but the resolution was not high enough to discern surface features. The spacecraft also observed Saturn's rings, revealing that there was material within the ring gaps, indicating that the gaps were not completely empty. Pioneer 11 also measured the temperature of Saturn's moon Titan.

  <li>Actual Mission
<br>&emsp;
。Cassini-Huygens:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;
      - Launch Date: October 5, 1997<br>&emsp;&emsp;
      - Arrival Date: April 26, 1998 (Orbiter)<br>&emsp;&emsp; - Organization: NASA<br>&emsp;&emsp; - Instrument: Spacecraft<br>&emsp;&emsp; - Result: Operated for over 13 years, entered Saturn's atmosphere and burned up on <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;September 15, 2017<br>Cassini-Huygens was launched in 1997 and entered orbit around Saturn in 2004. During its mission, which lasted over 13 years (three times longer than originally planned), Cassini-Huygens made several significant discoveries. It found and imaged new moons orbiting Saturn and collected data on Saturn's atmosphere and ring system. Cassini-Huygens also carried the Huygens probe, which landed on Saturn's moon Titan in 2005. The probe captured numerous images and conducted measurements of Titan's atmosphere and surface, revealing a landscape covered with rocks or icy pebbles. It also helped scientists discover the presence of large lakes filled with hydrocarbons, similar to automotive fuels, on Titan.


    
  <h2>Trip Planning Details:</h2>
    <ul style='list-style-position:outside;'>
    <ul class='details'>
   
  <li>Flight Route<br>&emsp;Earth(NASA Headquarters) → Saturn(Ontario Lacus)
  <li>Estimated Flight Time(Cassini)<br>&emsp;The Cassini spacecraft took approximately 3 years and 2 months to travel from Earth to Saturn.
  <li>The Necessities<br>&emsp;Astronaut Food<br>&emsp;&emsp;About 2000-3000 (cal/day) per person * 37 (months) = 26,640-39,960 (kcal/day) each person

      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      A methane-ethane lake near the south pole of Titan, confirmed to be a hydrocarbon lake. It covers an area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers and is named after Lake Ontario in North America due to its size and shape similarity.

      <font size="4">Ⅱ. Ligeia Mare</font>
      <p class="attraction-introduction">
      A lake on Saturn's moon Titan primarily composed of liquid methane, with a diameter of approximately 500 kilometers and a surface area of about 100,000 square kilometers. It has a coastline that stretches over 2,000 kilometers and is similar in size and shape to North America's Great Lakes. Ligeia Mare has two distinct types of coastlines, one characterized by circular features and erosion, and the other by lower, smoother terrain with more extended river channels. The circular features are mainly found in the eastern and southern parts of Ligeia Mare, while the smoother coastline dominates the western and northern regions.
